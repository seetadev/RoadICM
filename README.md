Near Blockchain technology to make driving safer and monitored 

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Near blockchain protocol, IPFS/Filecoin blockchain solutions using fluence p2p infrastructure for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy. 

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ ((https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/openaq.yaml) dataset along with Near blockchain.

Any abnormal behaviour/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle.

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface.

The decentralized Cloud-Connected Car Drives IoT Monetization. Real-time access to car availability and mobile connectivity enables better decisions making systems.


## How we built it

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with Near integration, NFT.Storage (IPFS/Filecoin) for snapshots of road incident, Near based wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ ((https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/openaq.yaml) and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, Near based solutions for security and  for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, Near for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with Near Blockchain. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Near blockchain network using NFT.Storage, Near protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using Sequence wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.
