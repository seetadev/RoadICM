# RoadICM
Near Blockchain technology, Web3 eco-system tools to make driving safer and monitored. 

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Near blockchain protocol, IPFS/Filecoin blockchain solutions using fluence p2p infrastructure for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy. 

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. Video footage for abnormal driver behaviour (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source solutions and ASDI OpenAQ dataset along with Near blockchain.

Any abnormal behaviour/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle.

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface.

The decentralized Cloud-Connected Car Drives IoT Monetization. Real-time access to car availability and mobile connectivity enables better decisions making systems.


## How we built it

We have developed a road incident management system using Javascript, HTML5, SAP's UI5 on the front end using open source video streaming system, Near blockchain, ASDI OpenAQ and crowdsourcing marketplace enabled by Near blockchain for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and control powered by SocialCalc, Near integration with Fluence for infrastructure and access of data from Near blockchains, NFT.Storage, Near protocol for security and for data retrieval and at the road incident spot for better coordination and immediate action.

Near low code framework tools and community tooling for analytics platform: Secure data storage, transparent data movement, data analytics and data authenticity using Near low code tools.

We are also utilizing Near Protocol to receive road incident feedback reports by citizens, store feedback details from both users and government officials on the incident reports so that they could strategize more productively and do early stage prevention of incidents.

Near's license NFT registration module is to enable users to register their driving licenses as well as their vehicle registration details in a decentralized manner. An individual can be identified by his/her SSN and a vehicle by Vehicle Registry Number both of which for now are integers between 0 and 65535 (16 bit integers). Every SSN or individual is associated to an address of an individual Near account. We are developing our own NFT smart contract from the ground up following Near's NEP-171 standard and the key tutorial shared at the Near github website. We are also logging the identities of the driving license owners, their vehicle assets using exchange of unique identifiers powered by Near.

An initial attempt to learn and develop the Near NFT solution from the Near tutorials/examples was made during the course of NEAR MetaBuild III hackathon  (please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/Near-Vehicle-Registration-NFT ) We are also using Rust smart contract template on Near blockchain: https://github.com/seetadev/RoadICM/tree/main/electronicincidentmanagement/Near-rust-smart-contracts

We are also developing an NFT marketplace using Near blockchain for NFC tags of monitoring devices at roads, which includes CCTV cameras and UAV devices. This will enable better transparency in road incident management and early stage detection of the incidents. NFC tags will be end commissioned before use.

Asset Management, Automation and Reducing decentralized Transaction Costs in Road ICM: We are utilizing xrpl-py-lite for asset management, automation and reducing transaction costs with XRP Ledger in Transport ICM. This is especially useful for enabling Transport ICM at all levels - citizen, dispatcher, Ministry of Road and Transportation and Fleet Organizations.


# How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with Near integration, NFT.Storage (IPFS/Filecoin) for snapshots of road incident, Near based wallet for toll ticketing, data retrieval.

Object Detection using open source AWS solutions, air quality measurements with ASDI OpenAQ and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, Near based solutions for security and  for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source AWS for streaming, Near for security and for snapshots.

Alarm storage using IPFS with Near Blockchain. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Near blockchain network using NFT.Storage, Near protocol based solutions for security and for data retrieval.. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. We are using Sequence wallet for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for road incidents and alarms.
